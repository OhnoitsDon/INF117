        <h2 id="mission">Mission Statement</h2>
        <p>1. Provide a forum to share knowledge and technology relevant to the game engineering disciplines.</p>
        <p>2. Encourage students interested in electronic game technologies to consider careers in science and
            engineering.</p> 
        <p> 3. Support development of electronic game industry standards.</p>
          <hr>

        <h2 id="methodology">Methodology</h2>
          <p>Our interest lies primarily in the state-of-the-art of the Video/Computer game technology, 
            both hardware and software, the future of that technology, and its application in areas such
            as education and family entertainment, including both stand-alone and massive multiplayer 
            online technologies.</p>
          
          <p>1. Inter-disciplinary frameworks: We expect to implement our vision through the auspices
            of existing technical societies. Our role shall be to facilitate inter-discipline communication
            regarding those aspects of our technical societies relevant to video and computer game technology. 
            Our goal is to not duplicate existing technical societies, but rather to identify and make available
            to our membership those multi-disciplinary resources relevant to game engineering. We intend to
            participate in existing technical society symposia and conferences, and eventually to co-sponsor
            Game Engineering symposia and conferences with our sister technical societies. Video and computer 
            game technology will be addressed as an engineering discipline.</p>
          
          <p>2. Engineering Career Guidance: We fully expect to engage the millions of game playing students
            of all ages through this intrinsic interest, encourage their appreciation of the technology,
            and thus provide a conduit for the next generation to access science and engineering education.</p>
          
          <p>3. Industry Standards: The viable future of the game industry requires establishment of accepted industry
            standards. Our role will be to create an environment in which these standards can be developed. The IEEE
            is the organization most suited to this activity.</p>
