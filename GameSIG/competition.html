                <p>Between 30 and 50 teams will submit a video promoting their game this year. Consider your video as a "movie trailer" or "marketing pitch". Your video will be individually reviewed by a group of industry and academic personnel. They will rank each submission based on their perceptions of the potential game play experience and marketability of the product as shown in the video. They will also evaluate the conformity of the design to the one-page PDF document.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                Only the ten highest-ranking submissions will be accepted for the final round of the competition. Your video needs to be engaging. It needs to clearly explain the strengths of the design and why it will appeal to your target audience.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                It is expected that teams will modify their games after submitting a video, but only one video may be submitted. Judges will not see the videos. They will make their final judgments based on the live demos given during the event.
